# Week 01 Summary

While I had little to do with Kubernetes during my internship at Microsoft in the summer of 2025, this week was more about solidifying my knowledge of the basics of Kubernetes. I mostly created the following resources in Kubernetes:

- Pods  
- ReplicaSets  
- Deployments  
- Services  
- Namespaces  

## Major things I learned this week that I’m happy about

- Perfecting my writing of YAML files for the resources mentioned above. Writing the files always seemed like a hassle to me, and it felt like there was too much information to keep track of.

- Finding better ways of writing the files by using imperative commands to get started or make things quicker in general, helping me avoid mistakes.

- Debugging a couple of YAML files during the labs this week, which helped improve my ability to spot mistakes in situations like this.

This is just Week 1, and I’m excited about the journey toward getting my CKAD certification.
