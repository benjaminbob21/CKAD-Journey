# My Kubernetes (CKAD) Learning Journey

Hi, I'm **Benjamin Bamisile**.

This repository documents my structured preparation for the Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) certification.

Although I had some exposure to Kubernetes during my internship at Microsoft in the summer of 2025, this journey is focused on strengthening my hands-on skills, deepening my understanding of Kubernetes architecture, becoming confident in deploying and managing applications in a Kubernetes environment. Ultimately, becoming certified!

I am currently following the Kubernetes Certified Application Developer (CKAD) course by Mumshad Mannambeth on Udemy.

This repository will grow as I continue building deeper Kubernetes expertise.
